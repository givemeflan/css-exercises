# css-exercises
This repository will hold exercises where I practice CSS, floats, resets and other important design elements. 

## Exercise List 
*1.) Basic Floats 

## Basic Floats 
This first exercise here was about practicing floats. I didn't do much much floating other than with the nav bar (float left, float right) but an important thing to practice regardless! The links on this mock webpage do not work or are attached to other webpages. In the future, I may want to do a faux space airline type of mock website. We shall see!
