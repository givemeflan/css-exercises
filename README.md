# css-exercises
Hi hi again! This repository will hold exercises where I practice CSS, floats, resets and other important design elements. The mini projects in this repo are based on previous exercises/homework assignments I did with UNCC's Bootcamp Certificate Program just like the [first-html](https://github.com/givemeflan/first-html-exercises) repo. They will have the givemeflan sparkle of course :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Exercise List 
- Basic Floats 
- Fixed, Relative, & Position Properties

### Basic Floats 
This first exercise here was about practicing floats. I didn't do much much floating other than with the nav bar (float left, float right) but an important thing to practice regardless! The links on this mock webpage do not work or are attached to other webpages. In the future, I may want to do a faux space airline type of mock website. We shall see! :rocket:

### Fixed, Relative, & Position Properties
If you are thinking, whoa this is not pretty....well, I totally agree with you! I tried to keep the layout somewhat similar to the exercise done in the certification program. It might not look like it, but the fixed, relative, and position properties are in the code!
