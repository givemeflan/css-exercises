# css-exercises
This repository will hold exercises where I practice CSS, floats, resets and other important design elements. 

## Exercise List 
*1.) Basic Floats 

## Basic Floats 
This first exercise here was about practicing floats. I didn't do much much floating other than with the nav bar but an important thing to practice regardless!
